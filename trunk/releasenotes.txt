- Sorry for the lack of updates to this document. Here's a summary of the work since r106, 8 months ago.
--- Added support for Daisy books from European sources e.g. Spanish, Norwegian, Danish, etc. The challenge was handling various forms of encoding of the XML files and convincing the SAX parser to process them correctly.
--- There are partial German and Norwegian translations provided by users. I'm happy to add other translations and localization to the software if you're willing to help translate the software.
--- Adding a simple visual user-interface to make the software more useful to users who can see text, e.g. users with dyslexia.
--- Adding an initial menu to allow users to manage their existing books, the books still need to be installed independently of this program.
--- Numerous improvements and fixes to the code.

Active development now relies on my work, other contributors seem to have stopped contributing over the last 6 months or so. They, and new contributors, are welcome.

There are plenty of improvements I'd like to include. These are grouped into core player functions, support for more formats of books, and providing better support to download and store Daisy books.
- core player functions: The player still 'stops' after a period of inactivity - probably the activity is paused by Android to save power. Users would like it to continue reading to the end of a book. Potentially they might like a sleep function (to allow the player to play for a period before stopping when the user is going to sleep).
- support for more formats: Gary contributed some code that interprets DAISY 2.02 files into the DAISY 3 structures. We still need to integrate this work, and add support for full-audio Daisy 3 books. We'd also like to add support for full-text books and for multi-media content (e.g. with synchronized text and audio).
- better support to download and store Daisy books: Currently books have to be downloaded independently of this program. We've planned to add a module to make downloading easier (and for that module to be replaceable e.g. by specific digital libraries such as the NLB, ONCE, etc.). Also, since many of the books are packaged in a zip file format we want to enable the software to read such zipped books directly rather than needing them to be unpacked first.

There are about 12 downloads of the current version of the software from the development site, enough to encourage me to continue this work :)

r106 02 Apr 2010
- This just might work well enough to be tolerable by users. There's still a lot that needs to be cleaned up in the code in order to make the player support things like navigation by page number, and there are some fairly ugly hacks in the code at the moment. However I've managed to address some of the navigation issues so that sections are no longer played several times when the book contains page numbers for a given section. Some tests have also been added over the last few changes for DaisyParser as a pre-cursor for restructuring of the code. Retrofitting tests should help to improve the code further :)

r101 22 Mar 2010
- Added a rough-cut icon for the application, it doesn't have transparancy and will need replacing at some point :)

r99 19 Mar 2010
- Development has restarted after a hiatus (where we were distracted by day jobs). r99 now supports the new gestures (described on the wiki http://code.google.com/p/android-daisy-epub-reader/wiki/UxReviewForAndroidDaisyBookReader ) and has some crude instructions for the player available from the menu button. There is a long-term and annoying bug in the player where some content is played several times http://code.google.com/p/android-daisy-epub-reader/issues/detail?id=14 and we are still only supporting DAISY 202 format books. 

We need to restructure the code (as described in the wiki page mentioned in the previous paragraph).

r81 11 Jan 2010
- We've now integrated the new SMIL parser with the rest of the project. We've also added Junit tests for several classes, and intend to add more. The Wiki pages include some of our design notes and current intentions, including some thoughts on segmenting the functionality into distinct software modules. Currently support is still limited to DAISY 202 audio books, we still expect to add support for DAISY3 and epub book formats soon. The project received it's first structured User Experience (UX) review last week, and the results will be added to the site, hopefully by the end of this week.

r44 13 Dec 2009
- A mid-point in a re-design to enable the player to handle DAISY books which don't have audio. Earlier versions went into an infinite loop when the program tried to open and play a text-based DAISY book. The re-design is incomplete and there seem to be a few new problems I've introduced during the rework that affects the playing of the audio books. However, rather than wait several days and risk having to merge my changes with other changes, etc. I've decided to share the interim work.

Also, please read the new Wiki pages on the site which include various links, design notes, testing notes, etc.

I'll continue working on the re-design early this week (14th / 15th December 2009) and try to get the code to the point where it can at least display the text for text segments. We probably need to re-think the current design and responsibilities of DaisyBook and the SmilFile classes.

- The application now saves the playing state between orientation changes e.g. from landscape to portrait. The code is empirical and based on experimentation, so it can probably be improved. Feel free to do so.
